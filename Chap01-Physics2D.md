# Unity Physics

Imagine a game that has no movements of players and enemies its just few blocks that are static, it would be such a dull game if we canâ€™t interact with our player and enemies right??!! ðŸ˜¢ 

Thatâ€™s where Physics comes into action. In Unity using Physics we can add a force to a game object to make it move when it pushed by the player or hit, we can add velocity to it, we can play around with gravity and a lot of other stuff can be done. These are all things that we see in real life that we can implement in Unity.
