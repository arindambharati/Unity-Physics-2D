# Unity Physics 2D

Imagine a game that has no movements of players and enemies its just few blocks that are static, it would be such a dull game if we canâ€™t interact with our player and enemies right??!! ðŸ˜¢ 

Thatâ€™s where Physics comes into action. In Unity using Physics we can add a force to a game object to make it move when it pushed by the player or hit, we can add velocity to it, we can play around with gravity and a lot of other stuff can be done. These are all things that we see in real life that we can implement in Unity.

Some of the main components of Physics are :

1. Colliders
2. Triggers
3. Rigidbody
4. Raycasts
5. Forces
6. Gravity
7. Velocity
