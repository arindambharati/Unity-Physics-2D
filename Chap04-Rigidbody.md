## Rigidbody : 

- Rigidbodies are components that allow a GameObject to react toÂ **real-time physics**. This includes reactions to forces and gravity, mass, drag and momentum.
- You can attach a Rigidbody to your GameObject by simply clicking onÂ **Add Component**Â and typing in Rigidbody2D in the search field.

- You will see that a new row ofÂ **RigidBody 2D**Â features is added in theÂ inspector **view, just below the Transform component.

- If we play our game now you will see that our game object drops down due to the gravity which looks no fun. To rectify this we can simply change the Gravity scale from 1 from 0.

- By changing the gravity scale of that Rigidbody, you're basically defining how much the object is affected by gravity. In fact, try changing around the mass and gravity scale to different values and see what happens. The object still has a mass, it just doesn't care for the forces of gravity acting on it, and thus remains where it is.
- We can explore many other things by changing their values and noticing how the game object reacts.
